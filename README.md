# 🛍️ E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from a UK-based e-commerce store to uncover key business insights. Using Python and SQL (via pandasql), I explored purchasing trends, top-performing products, and revenue patterns across time and regions.


## 📌 Overview

I worked with a real-world transactional dataset containing invoices, product details, customer IDs, and order timestamps. The goal was to answer common business questions through data analysis and present the results in a clear, visual format.


## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL (pandasql for SQL-style querying)
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)


## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

- How much total revenue did the store generate?
- Which products brought in the most revenue?
- How did sales trend month over month?
- Which countries placed the most orders?


## 📊 Final Insights (Dashboard)

- **Top-selling products** accounted for a significant portion of total revenue
- **United Kingdom** was by far the largest market
- **Revenue spikes** were observed around November–December (holiday season)
- **Monthly revenue trend** showed seasonal buying behavior

All charts and tables are included at the end of the notebook in a dashboard-style summary.
